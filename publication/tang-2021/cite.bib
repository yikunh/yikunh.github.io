 abstract = {Status code mappings reveal state shifts of a program, mapping one status code to another. Due to careless programming or the lack of the system-wide knowledge of a whole program, developers can make incorrect mappings. Such errors are widely spread across modern software, some of which have even become critical vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, existing solutions merely focus on single status code values, while never considering the relationships, that is, mappings, among them. Therefore, it is imperative to propose an effective method to detect status code mapping errors.},
