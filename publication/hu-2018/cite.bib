 abstract = {Binary code clone analysis is an important technique which has a wide range of applications in software engineering (e.g., plagiarism detection, bug detection). The main challenge of the topic lies in the semantics-equivalent code transformation (e.g., optimization, obfuscation) which would alter representations of binary code tremendously. Another challenge is the trade-off between detection accuracy and coverage. Unfortunately, existing techniques still rely on semantics-less code features which are susceptible to the code transformation. Besides, they adopt merely either a static or a dynamic approach to detect binary code clones, which cannot achieve high accuracy and coverage simultaneously.},
