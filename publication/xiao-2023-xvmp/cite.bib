 abstract = {Obfuscation techniques are widely used to protect the digital copyright and intellectual property rights of software. Among them, code virtualization is one of the most powerful obfuscation techniques, which hides both the control ﬂow and the data ﬂow of the code, thereby preventing code from being decompiled. However, existing code virtualization solutions are not well-resistant to de-obfuscation techniques (e.g., symbolic execution and frequency analysis), and only target limited program languages and architectures, which are challenging to integrate into the process of software development and maintenance.},
